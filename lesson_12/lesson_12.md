# Response to assignment:

At the time of writing this note, I am enrolling in my 3-rd year of studies. I will not be able physically get a full-time job soon. 
Only in a year I will be able to apply for different jobs.  

One possible solution for me is to come to companies and ask to study/internship in their company for free. My key takeaway will be that my goal is to get the production knowledge of data engineering. Therefore I will be able to get the necessary experience, skills from real-world companies on existing problems.

Why I chose to do so? Because it is almost impossible to find an online junior data engineering job not even talking about an internship.

So my plan, for now is:

1. Learn about data engineering on a daily basis. (All the time)
2. Finish the current data engineering 101 course. (until 14.09.2024)
    3.1 Look for the companies that can share their knowledge or provide an online internship for free. (until 01.10.2024)  
    3.2 In the meantime, practice my DSA skills.
4. This part will depend on if I will be able to find such company. So I will either study in that company or work on my personal portfolio.
