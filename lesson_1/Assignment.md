## Question:
 Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? 
 How would you go about gathering requirements? 
 
 Hint: Think backward from what the business may need. 

First, it is important to gather all the requirments from the stakeholders. I would start asking open questions to understand what business problem the company is trying to solve.

Next, I would ask about the exact metrics the stakeholders want to see. For the metrics I will need the data. My next step would be figuring out if the company has already a data warehouse and an operational database. 

If not, I will start designing a schema for the data warehouse based on gathered requirements from the stakeholders. 

After, I will be designing and implementing the ETL pipeline to finally enable data analytics.

The pipeline is not the end of my work but rather a start. Logging, metadata management, scaling, debugging - all these are my tasks in the nearest future.
